# Note Taker by Russell Morgan

## Description
This week's challenge was to create a web server using 'express.js'. The front end was supplied and we needed to add routes to the server to retrieve all the notes and a route to add a new note. Upon entering 'http://localhost:3001' from a browser page, we would be directed to a landing page. Selecting the 'Get Started' link we would be transfered to the note page where we would see the saved notes and be able to create new ones. Selecting an existing note on the left would load it on the right.


## Installation
Clone the respository from the GitHub link listed below.


## Usage
Start the server by entering 'npm start' at a terminal command line. Then start your browser and use address 'http://localhost:3001'. This will take you to the landing page.


## Tests
No tests were required for this challenge.
